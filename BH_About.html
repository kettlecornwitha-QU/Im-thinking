<h1>About my Maze Generator</h1>
<p>
This web app displays a number for each square on the Battleship board which corresponds to the likelihood that it is occupied by a ship.  You pick a square to shoot in your actual game, which may be a hit or a miss, then you select the same square in the app's board to shoot.  The board then updates the scores in each square accordingly.
<p>
One thing to keep in mind is that this app is only meant to help guide you in hunting for ships.  Once you land a hit, however, use your common sense to shoot adjacent squares until the ship is sunk.

And once again, just like with my other two web apps, the backend is being hosted on a free server, so after about 15 minutes of inactivity, it spins down, so when you first open the web page, it might take about a minute for the backend logic to wake up.  Refreshing the page wipes the board clean.
