Science is only meant to find natural causes of phenomena.  Therefore, in order to do their job, scientists <i>must</i> assume <i>a priori</i> that a given phenomenon has no supernatural cause.  For people to then deduce that reality consists of nothing beyond the physical because science can't find it is like a microbiologist deducing that there is no such thing as elephants because she's never seen one through her microscope.

There is a distinction between free will and the ability to make choices that many metaphysical naturalists and physicists do not recognize.  I say this because many metaphysical naturalists believe that humans have free will, and many physicists who consider closed timelike curves or ones with loops talk only of restrictions in free will.  Having free will does not mean being able to make choices&mdash; every animal with a brain has the ability to make choices.  Having free will means having <i>control</i> over your choices.  If this physical universe is all there is, where could this control possibly come from?  Our choices would simply be the result of electrochemical impulses in our brains, over which we have no more control than a hamster has.  The mere concept of control implies the supernatural.

The weak Sapir-Whorf hypothesis basically says that the language you speak doesn't just give you a way to express your thoughts&mdash; it actually influences your worldview, cognition, and what thoughts you have or are even capable of having.  Most linguists don't give credence to this idea, but as a mathematician at heart, I think there's something to it, or at least to the idea that certain thoughts or concepts are unable to be conceived in the human mind without some specific language structure.  Of course there are many thoughts humans are capable of having without any language.  For example: even if the mathematical language you use doesn't have any representation for addition, a human is still capable of understanding that 2 + 3 = 5.  However, the Raychaudhuri equation is, in my opinion, a concept that cannot be understood without first learning the language of arithmetic, then the language of basic algebra, then the language of basic geometry, then the language of basic calculus, then the language of linear algebra and vector calculus, and finally the language of tensor calculus and Riemannian geometry.  And this idea of needing specific language scaffolding in order to gain an intuitive understanding of some concept that would otherwise be unattainable extends to many areas of advanced study&mdash; it's just that nowhere is this more apparent than in the broad fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.

Many people seem to believe that Pascal's wager is supposed to be an argument for theism.  It's not.  Rather, it is a rudimentary risk-benefit analysis on theism and atheism.  Opponents of Pascal's wager are correct in saying that this analysis provides us with absolutely no information on which god we should believe in, but it does tell us that there is greater incentive to roll the dice than to not play at all&mdash; or, if you have any ability to reason, then instead of rolling the dice, you could critically evaluate the options and go with the one that makes the most sense.  It so happens that, to me, the God of Christianity makes more sense than all other gods, so Pascal's wager tells me that following this God provides a better risk-benefit profile than not following him.  Happily for me, though, this God's existence is not only prudent for me to wager, but it even makes more sense to me than atheism.

Many smart people, such as Sam Harris, fail to distinguish between the arguments &ldquo;without God we have no basis on which to argue moral obligation&rdquo; and &ldquo;without God we have no way to know right from wrong&rdquo;.  For example, Sam Harris argues that science <i>can</i> answer moral questions, saying things like, &ldquo;Everybody knows that mutilating girls' genitalia is wrong.&rdquo;  I would respond by stating that, first of all, not everyone <i>does</i> know that this is wrong (<i>e.g.</i> the cultures that practice this).  But more importantly, many people have no <i>basis</i> for this knowledge.  Here's an example of knowledge for which I have a basis: I know that if you have two stopwatches, and you throw one directly upwards while the other rests on a platform at the same height at which the thrown one was released, and both start time at that moment of release, and stop time when the thrown one falls back down to the same height as the resting one, assuming your stopwatches and start and stop times are precise and accurate enough, the thrown stopwatch will show a greater elapsed time than the resting one.  My basis for this knowledge is the theory of general relativity, and our basis for this theory are the countless observations that match the predictions the theory makes.  It's important to note, however, that most of the things that we <i>think</i> we know are not, in fact, based upon any sort of scientific theory.  For example, there is no scientific theory that supports the knowledge that killing the weak is wrong, so clearly, science is not the only basis for our knowledge.  So what is the basis for the knowledge that killing the weak is wrong?  For a Christian, that question is very easy to answer: we believe God created every person in his image, and should thus be treated with love, kindness, respect, and dignity.  For an atheist, however, as far as I can see, the best one can do is to say, &ldquo;I don't like the idea of killing the weak, so I'm not going to do it, and I'd prefer that other people don't do it either.&rdquo;
