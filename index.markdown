What stuff am I thinking about, you ask?  See for yourself:

## Stuff

- [Birkhoff and Schwarzschild]({{ '/Birkhoff.html' | relative_url }})\
  *A quick proof of Birkhoff’s theorem (showing that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein’s field equations must also be static) as well as a derivation of the Schwarzschild metric*
- [Proper vs. Coordinate Time with Constant Acceleration]({{ '/Constant_Acceleration_Travel_Times.html' | relative_url }})\
  *A person goes somewhere.  How long does the person say the trip took?  And how long did it take according to the people that the person left behind?*
- [Prisoners, Boxes, and Cards Riddle]({{ '/Partition_Counts.html' | relative_url }})\
  *There's a good chance the warden will set the prisoners free if they're clever enough.  Unfortunately for the community, one of the prisoners is a number theorist.*
- [Levi-Civita Connection and Covariant Derivative]({{ '/Levi-Civita_Connection.html' | relative_url }})\
  *We've all wondered at one time or another how to explain the Levi-Civita connection and covariant derivative to someone with just a basic understanding of vector calculus.  Well this is my attempt.*
- [Lorentz Transformation Derivation]({{ '/SR.html' | relative_url }})\
  *'Nuff said.*
- [WLC Was Wrong about Bergson Being (partly) Right about Relativity]({{ '/WLC_Time.html' | relative_url }})\
  *The title is clever, trust me. (Also, WLC = William Lane Craig)*
- [Chain Rule Derivation]({{ '/Chain_Rule.html' | relative_url }})\
  *If you're like me, you use the chain rule all the time, but you've never seen for yourself whether it checks out or not.  Turns out it does!*
- [Crocheting Hyperbolic Discs]({{ '/Hyperbolic_Crochet.html' | relative_url }})\
  *I don't crochet much, but when I do, I crochet hyperbolic discs.*
