What stuff am I thinking about, you ask?  See for yourself:

## Stuff

- [Birkhoff and Schwarzschild](papers/Birkhoff.pdf)\
  *A quick proof of Birkhoff’s theorem (showing that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein’s field equations must also be static) as well as a derivation of the Schwarzschild metric*
- [Proper vs. Coordinate Time with Constant Acceleration](papers/Constant_Acceleration_Travel_Times.pdf)\
  *A person goes somewhere.  How long does the person say the trip took?  And how long did it take according to the people that the person left behind?*
- [Prisoners, Boxes, and Cards Riddle](papers/Partition_Counts.pdf)\
  *There's a good chance the warden will set the prisoners free if they're clever enough.  Unfortunately for the community, one of the prisoners is a number theorist.*
- [Levi-Civita Connection and Covariant Derivative](papers/Levi-Civita_Connection.pdf)\
  *We've all wondered at one time or another how to explain the Levi-Civita connection and covariant derivative to someone with just a basic understanding of vector calculus.  Well this is my attempt.*
- [Lorentz Transformation Derivation](papers/SR.pdf)\
  *'Nuff said.*
- [WLC Was Wrong about Bergson Being (partly) Right about Relativity](papers/WLC_Time.pdf)\
  *The title is clever, trust me. (Also, WLC = William Lane Craig)*
- [Chain Rule Derivation](papers/Chain_Rule.pdf)\
  *If you're like me, you use the chain rule all the time, but you've never seen for yourself whether it checks out or not.  Turns out it does!*
- [Crocheting Hyperbolic Discs](papers/Hyperbolic_Crochet.pdf)\
  *I don't crochet much, but when I do, I crochet hyperbolic discs.*
