<h1>About my Maze Generator</h1>
<p>
Not too much to say about this one.  First, just like with my tensor calculator, the backend is being hosted on a free server, so after about 15 minutes of inactivity, it spins down.  This means that the first time you press the &ldquo;Generate Maze&rdquo; button, it might take about a minute for the maze to generate, but after that, it should only take a fraction of a second.
</p>
<p>
Second, setting the branch weight to 0 does not mean no branching.  The logic I used to generate the maze makes it almost certain that there will be <i>some</i> branching; increasing the weights simply increases the likelihood that there will be branching during the generation of the maze.
